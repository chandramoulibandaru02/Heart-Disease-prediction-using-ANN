 Heart Disease Prediction using ANN (Sigmoid)
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the presence of heart disease based on basic medical features. It's a text-based model, with no preprocessing or feature scaling â€” raw values are used directly for prediction.

âœ… What This Project Does
Loads heart disease data
Uses ANN to train on 13 features
Accepts new user input (in the same format)
Outputs prediction as:
0 â†’ No heart disease
1 â†’ Heart disease likely
